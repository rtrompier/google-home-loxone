# GOOGLE HOME FOR LOXONE

## Requirements

To use this plugin, you have to create your own SmartHome project in google : https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/develop/create

### Set up an OAuth 2.0 server

We suggest to use the free oauth 2.0 server : OAuth0

1. Create an account or login
1. Create a new application (Eg : Google Home)
1. In **Allowed Callback URLs** section, add https://oauth-redirect.googleusercontent.com/r/YOUR_GOOGLE_PROJECTNAME

###Â Create an Actions on Google developer project

1. Use your Oauth0 App ClientId et ClientSecret, created before, in the Account Linking Section
![Account Linking](readme/account-linking.png?raw=true "Account Linking")
1. In the Fulfillment section, use the **google-home-loxone** url (Eg : http://YOUR_IP:3000/smarthome). It must be accessible from the cloud.


### Request State Config
The Report State feature allows a cloud integration to proactively provide the
current state of devices to the Home Graph without a `QUERY` request. This is
done securely through [JWT (JSON web tokens)](https://jwt.io/).

1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis) for your project id.
1. Enable the [HomeGraph API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/homegraph.googleapis.com/overview). This will be used to request a new sync and to report the state back to the HomeGraph.
1. Click Credentials
1. Click 'Create credentials'
1. Click 'Service Account'
1. Create a new service account by folling steps (without specific role)
1. Edit the service account and add a new JSON key
1. Download the key and save it in your home directory ~/.google-home-loxone/jwt.json
   
## How to start
